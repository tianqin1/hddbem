A prototype program that apply the hierarchical domain decomposition boundary element method (HDD-BEM) into the multi-group neutron diffusion equation and sp3 equation in 1-D geometry.

In the src folder,
Run python Main.py

by default, 3-group diffusion calculation will conducted.

src_m is another version that can read external XS data, and call additional packages to solve the equations, also 3-region implementation is included in src_m/HDDBEM.py
